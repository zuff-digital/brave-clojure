# Brave Clojure

- This repo contains my exercises from the book [_Clojure for the Brave and True_](https://www.braveclojure.com/) by Daniel Higginbotham.
- Going chapter by chapter alongside some cool folks on the [Brave Clojurians](https://asamonek.github.io/events/2021/01/01/beginner-clojurians-online-meetup.html) Discord server.
